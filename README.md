# Bushel

Bushel's help with collecting apples. So heres a UICollectionView framework named Bushel. It is opinionated & constraining, which is just what you need to have something that is reliable and made to be used on multiple projects.

Bushel is an iOS Collection View Framework forked from Apple's Collection View framework release at WWDC 2014. [WWDC 2014 Session 232](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/resources/sample-code/)

Bushel is still under development and will be used in a future iOS app. I'll post more once that application is released. Nearly everything in the Application is a subclass from a Bushel class.
