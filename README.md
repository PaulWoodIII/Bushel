# Bushel

Bushel's help with collecting apples. So heres a UICollectionView framework named Bushel.

Bushel is an iOS Collection View Framework forked from Apple's Collection View framework release at WWDC 2014. It is opinionated & constraining, which is just what you need to have something that is reliable.

Bushel is still under development and will be used in a future iOS app.
