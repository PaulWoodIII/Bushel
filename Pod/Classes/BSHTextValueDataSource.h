 Abstract:
 
  A data source that populates its cells based on key/value information from a source object. The items in the data source are NSDictionary instances with the keys @"label" and @"keyPath". Any items for which the object does not have a value will not be displayed.
  This is a tad more complex than BSHKeyValueDataSource, because each item will be used to create a single item section. The value of the label will be used to create a section header.
